# Framework Selection

This document supports the [AGENTS plan](../AGENTS.md) by detailing the framework options for porting the Pomodoro timer to a native application.

## Windows First: WPF / WinUI 3 (.NET)
- **Rationale:** Provides direct access to Win32 and Windows Runtime APIs.
- **Benefits:** Small bundle sizes and the ability to run background services or tray applications.
- **Considerations:** Requires C#/.NET expertise and targets Windows only.

## Cross‑Platform: React Native
- **Rationale:** Enables iOS, Android, web, and desktop support with one JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
- **Benefits:** Reuses existing React skills and has community packages like `react-native-background-fetch` for background work.
- **Considerations:** Slightly larger bundle size and reliance on third‑party packages for some native features.

## Decision Points
1. Start with Windows using WPF/WinUI 3 to quickly deliver a fully native desktop experience.
2. Evaluate React Native once Windows functionality is stable to expand to other platforms.
3. Keep shared business logic modular to ease future cross‑platform migrations.
