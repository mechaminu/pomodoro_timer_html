# Future Enhancements

Aligned with the [AGENTS plan](../AGENTS.md), this document captures potential future improvements once the core app is stable.

## Ideas
- Keep the timer running when the browser or app window is minimized or closed.
- Provide data export to CSV or external services.
- Add advanced analytics like streak tracking or productivity predictions.
- Explore platform‑specific integrations such as calendar sync or system notifications.

## Action Steps
1. Monitor user feedback to prioritize enhancements.
2. Prototype features behind flags before full release.
3. Ensure cross‑platform compatibility for each new capability.

## Challenges
- Avoiding feature creep that complicates the core timer experience.
- Balancing new features with maintenance and performance.
