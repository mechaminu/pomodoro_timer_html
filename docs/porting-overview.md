# Native App Porting Overview

This document outlines the overall plan for porting the Simple Pomodoro Timer into native applications across platforms.

## Objectives
- Deliver a native experience on Windows and mobile platforms.
- Reuse existing web code where possible while embracing platform capabilities.
- Maintain feature parity with the existing web version.

## Phased Roadmap
1. **Foundation** – establish shared business logic and data storage mechanisms.
2. **Platform Implementations** – build Windows (WPF/WinUI 3) and React Native clients.
3. **Background Services** – ensure timers and notifications continue when the app is minimized.
4. **Activity Monitoring** – capture user input to generate a Focus Metric.
5. **Visualization and Analytics** – present real-time status and historical insights.
6. **Enhancements** – extend with export, analytics, and platform integrations.
