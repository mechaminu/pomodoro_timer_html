# Visualization

This document covers the user interface aspects for displaying timer status and historical data.

## Real-Time Display
- Show current session type, remaining time, and Focus Metric.
- Provide controls for start, pause, and reset.

## Historical Data
- Present charts of past Pomodoro sessions and focus scores.
- Allow filtering by date range and exporting to CSV.

## Platform Considerations
- Windows: leverage WinUI 3's `Chart` controls or community toolkits.
- React Native: use libraries like `react-native-svg` and `victory-native`.

## Next Steps
1. Define data models for historical sessions.
2. Prototype charts on each platform.
3. Ensure accessibility and theme support.
