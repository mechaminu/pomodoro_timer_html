# Visualization

Linked with [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), this document outlines how to present real‑time and historical timer data.

## Objectives
- Display current timer status with progress indicators.
- Provide graphs and statistics for past sessions.

## Action Steps
1. Build a dashboard component that reflects live timer state.
2. Render charts (e.g., line or bar graphs) of focus metrics and session history.
3. Allow filtering by date ranges or session types.
4. Ensure accessibility with readable colors and labels.

## Challenges
- Efficiently rendering graphs on resource‑constrained devices.
- Designing a clean UI that works across screen sizes.
