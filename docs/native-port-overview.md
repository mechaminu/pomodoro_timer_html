# Native Port Overview

This document outlines the overall approach for porting the web-based Pomodoro timer into native applications.

## Goals
- Provide a consistent user experience across Windows and mobile platforms.
- Maintain small bundle sizes and leverage existing code where possible.

## Strategy
1. Evaluate platform frameworks. See [Framework Selection](framework-selection.md).
2. Build feature modules incrementally:
   - [Core Timer](core-timer.md)
   - [Background Execution](background-execution.md)
   - [Activity Monitoring](activity-monitoring.md)
   - [Visualization](visualization.md)
   - [Future Enhancements](future-enhancements.md)
3. Reuse existing JavaScript logic where practical, especially in React Native.
4. Establish a shared design system for consistent UI elements.

## Milestones
- Prototype Windows desktop app using WinUI 3.
- Create React Native prototype targeting iOS and Android.
- Align data models and local storage approaches across platforms.
- Conduct user testing and iterate.
