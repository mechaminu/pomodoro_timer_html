# React Native Plan

This document captures the approach for delivering a cross-platform client using React Native.

## Technology
- **Framework**: React Native with TypeScript for iOS, Android, and web.
- **Packages**: `react-native-background-fetch` for periodic tasks and `expo-notifications` for alerts.
- **State Management**: Reuse existing React hooks and context from the web app.

## Background Execution
- Configure background fetch to trigger timer checks at regular intervals.
- Use platform-specific notification APIs to alert users when sessions end.

## Data Storage
- Store configuration and history using `AsyncStorage` or platform secure storage.

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Expo-managed workflow to simplify builds.
2. Extract reusable timer logic into a shared JavaScript module.
3. Implement notification handling and background fetch.
